# JobRunr example

This repository shows an advanced example how you can integrate JobRunr with [spring.io](https://spring.io/). In this example, Jobs are created via a web frontend (the `webapp` module) and processed in a different JVM (the `processingapp` module).

An easier example using [spring.io](https://spring.io/) can be found [here](https://github.com/jobrunr/example-java-mag)

## About this project
This project exists out of 3 modules:
- **core**: this project contains [MyService](core/src/main/java/org/jobrunr/examples/services/MyService.java), a simple spring service with two example methods which you want to run in a backgroundserver.  
- **processingapp**: this app is a Spring Console application and runs indefinitely. It polls for new background jobs
  and processes them when they arrive. It contains only a two classes:
  - the [JobServerApplication](processingapp/src/main/java/org/jobrunr/examples/processingapp/JobServerApplication.java) which is empty ðŸ™‚
  - the [JobServerConfiguration](processingapp/src/main/java/org/jobrunr/examples/processingapp/JobServerConfiguration.java) which starts the H2 Database (in server mode) and contains the database information
  > the thing to note here is the [`application.properties`](processingapp/src/main/resources/application.properties) where the server and the dashboard are enabled
- **webapp**: this is a Spring Rest Webapp that enqueues new background jobs. It contains a simple `RestController`
  called [JobController](webapp/src/main/java/org/jobrunr/examples/webapp/api/JobController.java) which contains some
  methods (= endpoints) to enqueue jobs.

## How to run this project:
- clone the project and open it in your favorite IDE that supports gradle
- First, run the main method from
    the [JobServerApplication](processingapp/src/main/java/org/jobrunr/examples/processingapp/JobServerApplication.java)
    in the `processingapp` module and also keep it running
- Run the main method from the [WebApplication](webapp/src/main/java/org/jobrunr/examples/webapp/WebApplication.java) in the `webapp` module and keep it running
- Open your favorite browser:
  - Navigate to the JobRunr dashboard located at http://localhost:8000/dashboard. This is running within
    the [JobServerApplication](processingapp/src/main/java/org/jobrunr/examples/processingapp/JobServerApplication.java).
  - To enqueue a simple job, open a new tab and go to http://localhost:8080/jobs/ and take it from there.
  - Visit the dashboard again and see the jobs being processed!
